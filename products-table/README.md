# Thinking in React

## Description

This project involves building a React application based on a provided mockup and JSON API. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Mockup and JSON API**: Start with the provided mockup and assume the existence of a JSON API.

2. **Step 1: Break Down UI**: Begin by breaking down the UI into a component hierarchy. Draw boxes around each component and subcomponent in the mockup, naming them accordingly.

3. **Step 2: Build Static Version in React**: Implement the application based on the component hierarchy. Develop a static version that renders the UI from the data model without incorporating interactivity.

4. **Step 3: Minimal UI State Representation**: Identify the minimal yet complete representation of UI state required for the application.

5. **Step 4: Determine State Management**: Determine where the application state should reside within the component hierarchy.

6. **Step 5: Implement Inverse Data Flow**: Add inverse data flow to the application, enabling communication from child to parent components.
